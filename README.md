# Flashlight on Call App

This Android application uses the device's camera flashlight to blink in response to incoming calls. The flashlight will start flashing when a call is ringing, and it stops when the call is answered or ends. The user can also manually toggle the flashlight on or off using a button in the app.

## Features

- **Flashlight Blinking on Incoming Calls**: The app listens for phone state changes and flashes the flashlight when a call is incoming (ringing).
- **Manual Flashlight Toggle**: A button allows the user to toggle the flashlight manually.
- **Camera Permission Handling**: The app requests and checks for camera permissions to use the flashlight.
- **Flashlight Error Handling**: Displays toast notifications if the flashlight is unavailable or an error occurs while toggling the flashlight.

## Requirements

- Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher
- Permission to access the camera and use the flashlight
- A device with a flashlight (camera with flash)
